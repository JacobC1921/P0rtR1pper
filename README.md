# 90sHackingSuite

This is a project I have started out of complete boredom. I am to bring you, the user, an experience similar to that of a 90s hacking movie, however it actually works.

I will be making my own tools, and uploading them to this account, for your personal enjoyment.

## P0rtR1pper (Port scanning)

Just a multi-threaded simple port scanner, uses the top 1000 ports to determine open services. Resolves ports to names for your ease.

### Usage:
```
$ ./P0rtR1pper <IPAddress 1> <IPAddress 2> ... <IPAddress N>
```

### <b>WARNING:</b>
This tool is <i>very</i> noisy, and can be seen very easily. I'm trying to research whether there is a way to scan every single port of the host stealthily, but so far, to no prevail.
