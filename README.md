# PortScan
...<i>by Jacob Collins</i>

This is a simple multi-threaded port scanner that uses vanilla bash to achieve results. It scans the top 1000 ports to determine open services. This tool will also resolve port numbers to their names for your ease.

## <b>WARNING:</b>
This tool is <i>very</i> noisy network wise, and can be seen and detected very easily. Infact, I dare you to run wireshark when you use this program, and see how it looks for yourself. I'm trying to figure out if there's a way to do this more subtly, but so far, to no prevail.
